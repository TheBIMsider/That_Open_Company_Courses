## Master BIM Software Developer
The step-by-step path to go from knowing zero about programming to becoming a BIM Software Developer and make a successful career out of it.

### Module 1: Creating Static Websites
This is a 16-lesson module with the final result being a static website to be used as the base of the future modules. 
This website will have a place for AECO Projects, Users, To-do lists, and an IFC model viewer. But first, we need to design the basic static website, which is this module's challenge.

This is the final project from Module 1, no JavaScript yet so no working buttons to show other pages

Here are some examples of the "New user form" and "User list page"
